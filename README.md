# Bosch Copilot Demo Site

This project is a live demonstration site created to showcase the advantages and practical applications of GitHub Copilot for developers at Bosch. As a member of the Bosch AI Task Force, I conducted sessions highlighting how Copilot can accelerate development, improve code quality, and enhance productivity through AI-powered code suggestions and automation.

The site was built using React and Tailwind CSS, and it features interactive tutorials, event information, and real-world examples of Copilot in action. The goal is to provide Bosch teams with hands-on experience and resources to adopt Copilot effectively in their daily workflows.

**Why this project?**

-   To educate and inspire Bosch developers about the benefits of AI-assisted development.
-   To provide a central resource for Copilot onboarding, tutorials, and best practices.
-   To demonstrate the real-world impact of Copilot through a modern, interactive web application.

## Features in this Project

-   **Interactive Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides and video walkthroughs on using Copilot and building modern web apps.
-   **Event Information:** Details about upcoming AI events and hackathons at Bosch.
-   **Installation Steps:** Clear instructions for onboarding and integrating Copilot with your IDE.
-   **Model & Mode Overviews:** Information about available AI models and Copilot usage modes.
-   **Live Demo:** Explore Copilotâ€™s capabilities in a real React + Tailwind CSS codebase.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to Build for Production

1. Build the app:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The optimized production build will be in the `build` folder.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
